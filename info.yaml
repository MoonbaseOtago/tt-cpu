  source_files:        # If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. Source files must be in ./src
    - cpu.v
  top_module:  "cpu_4bit"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  how_it_works: "verilog source"      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "needs a 7-bit external address latch and SRAM"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "sram, latch"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc

  inputs:               # a description of what the inputs do
    - clock
    - reset
    - ram_data0  # data in from RAM
    - ram_data1
    - ram_data2
    - ram_data3
    - io_data0   # IO in
    - io_data1
  outputs:

    - data_out_1
    - data_out_2
    - data_out_3
    - write_data_n   # write strobe* for external data
    - write_ram_n    # write strobe* for sram (hook this and strobe to a MWS5101AEL3)
    - a              # address upper bit
    - strobe         # when asserted address latch is loaded from the next 7 bits
